# quote-generator
Quote generator using GPT-2 to generate quotes from a model finetuned based on a dataset from a Facebook messenger group chat. This was just a leisure project, as I was interested in toying around with the text generation capabilities of GPT-2.

## How to run
Use trained GPT-2 simple model created from following this guide: https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/

Place extracted checkpoint folder in the same directory as app.py. Then run app.py and then GUI script to start local REST API and to use TKinter GUI to interact.
